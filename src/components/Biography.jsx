      <h3>Profile</h3>
      <p><em>I am a paralegal at Blackwell Sanders LLP.  On my spare time, I love to try out new recipes and sew home decor items, such as pillows and window treatments.  I enjoy sewing so much that I made every decorative item in my house.  Well, almost everything.  I am always looking for new ideas, so if you have something to share, please post!</em></p>
